My project is a fan page for Animal Crossing New Horizons. I decided to create a fan page for Animal Crossing New Horizons after playing the game for way too many hours during this pandemic.


The home page talks about why the game is great, including a Twitter feed for the Animal Crossing World Blog. The contact form invites people to submit their info so that we can be friends in the game and visit each others' islands.

The final page compares real life to the game and shows that the game is clearly superior to real life. While I don't actually believe that ACNH is better than real life, the game has been a nice escape.
